********************* DBG -- README ********************

The goal of this project was to produce a debugger similar
to gdb in order to debug C programs.


I/ How to launch my-dgb

The build system I used is CMake. Here are the steps to
follow to launch my-dbg:
    
    * Create a directory and change to that directory
    * Run command "cmake .."
    * Run "make"
    * Run "./my-dbg your_program"

I added c files in the test directory as a start.

II/ What my-dbg supports

I was able to create a simple debugger that can trace a C program
and perform various operations on it. Unfortunately it is not
a high level debugger but this is a list of what my-dbg supports:

    * Reading and writing to registers
    * Getting memory info on process
    * Breakpoints on adresses
    * Continue of execution
    * Single step for assembly instruction
    * Reading memory with d and x format
    * Backtrace
    * Temporary breakpoints
    * Delete of breakpoints
    * List of breakpoints


III/ How to use my-dbg

You have to work with the adresses in your program.
To identify them use "objdump -d your_program"
It will disassemble your executable and output
useful information.

IV/ Feedback

What I enjoyed about this project is that there was
different kind of commands/features that we could choose
to work on and improve.
However, I could not work on everyone of them but I
would gladly improve my-dbg durng my free time.
